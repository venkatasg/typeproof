# Typeproof
Inspired by <a href="https://jonathanhoefler.com/articles/how-to-proof-a-typeface">Jonathan Hoefler's essay</a> that illustrated the problems with 
pangrams as typeface proofs, I wanted to build a simple site that lets you proof any font from Google Fonts with his proof texts. Check it out at https://venkatasg.net/typeproof

Almost all(~95%) of the site was built with <a href="https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli">Gemini CLI</a>. If you find any errors or problems 
with the site, please do contact <a href="https://venkatasg.net">me</a> via <a href="mailto:gvenkata1994@gmail.com">email</a>,
